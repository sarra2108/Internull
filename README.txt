Product description : 
-The idea consists of having an app that allows international students to find properties to live in from their home country before even coming their desired country 
-Targeted towards the rich and middle Class. 
-The app would allow users to receive real time info about the property : 
-For apartments, it would tell its users how many people are currently living in the apartment AKA (Vacancy rate) 
-The app would also be able to tell a story about the neighborhood. (crime rate, shopping centers near the neighborhood, tourist attractions, the calmness of the neighborhood. 
-It would tell the proximity of the distance between the education institution and the residence 
-It would also show the price of rent for the property in their desired currency, using real-time info from Foreign Exchange Market 
-Properties would be rated from green, yellow or red depending on various criterias such as the ratings of people, the proximity of the property to amenities (entertainment, grocery stores, etc), the inside of the property, and other factors 
-The app or website will offer personalized properties to each user depending on their needs and wants (ex. an international student who wants to live in an area close to bars and nightclubs will get more results of properties that are near bars and nightclubs)
